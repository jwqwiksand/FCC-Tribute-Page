                <h3>The Ward Leonard Motor Control System</h3>
                <p>The Ward Leonard motor control system was Mr. Leonardâ€™s best known and most lasting invention. It was introduced in about 1891 and soon became the most widely used type of electric motor speed control. Although only technical specialists are likely to be familiar with Ward Leonard systems, many millions of people have ridden in elevators powered by Ward Leonard drives. From the 1920s through the 1980s most electrically driven elevators used Ward Leonard control and many systems remained in use at the beginning of the 21st century.</p>
